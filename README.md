# Movie Recomendation System
Dec 2024 - Jan 2025Dec 2024 - Jan 2025
Project: Movie Recommendation System

Developed a personalized movie recommendation system leveraging Machine Learning techniques and Python.
Utilized algorithms like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Matrix Factorization to suggest movies based on user preferences and ratings.
Implemented data preprocessing, including handling missing values, data normalization, and feature extraction from a dataset containing over 100,000 movie ratings.
Designed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for seamless interaction and recommendations.
Achieved a model accuracy of 85% using RMSE as a performance metric after hyperparameter tuning.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
